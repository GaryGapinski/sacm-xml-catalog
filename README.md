sacm-xml-catalog
================

XML Catalog for SACM-related schemata.

About
-----

sacm-xml-catalog provides copies of XML Schema documents commonly used in 
SACM/[SCAP](http://scap.nist.gov/)
XML documents allowing these copies to be used in lieu of direct
network access to the "canonical" locations. These schema documents do not
change very often, and local copies obviate the need for network access
to the schema documents.

Copies of various versions of
[XCCDF](http://scap.nist.gov/specifications/xccdf/)
, 
[CPE](http://cpe.mitre.org/)
, 
[OVAL](http://oval.mitre.org/)
, 
and 
[OCIL](http://scap.nist.gov/specifications/ocil/)
schemata are provided.

Usage
-----

Usage requires an 
[XML Catalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Catalog) 
aware implementation, such as
[libxml](http://www.xmlsoft.org/catalog.html)
.
